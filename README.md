# Facebook Event Scraper

This repository contains a powerful and reliable Facebook Event Scraper, capable of efficiently scraping all events based on a given location or filters. Additionally, it provides functionality to store the scraped event data in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file for easy access and analysis.

## Features

- **Location-Based Event Scraping**: Scrapes Facebook events based on a specific location or geographical area, making it easy to find events in a particular region.

- **Filtering Capabilities**: Allows users to apply various filters to refine event search results. You can filter events based on keywords, date ranges, categories, and more.

- **Data Storage**: Stores the scraped event data in a CSV file, providing a structured format for further analysis and integration with other tools.

- **Reliability**: This scraper is designed to work consistently, even as Facebook's website structure may change over time. It handles changes in Facebook's layout gracefully to ensure uninterrupted scraping.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Facebook Event Scraper, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/facebook-event-scraper.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary Python dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Usage**: Use the scraper by running the Python script `scraper.py`. Customize the location and filters according to your requirements:

   ```shell
   python scraper.py --location "New York, NY" --keywords "music, festival" --start-date "2023-01-01" --end-date "2023-12-31"
   ```

   Replace the arguments with your desired location, keywords, date range, and any other filters you wish to apply.

4. **CSV Output**: After scraping, the event data will be stored in a CSV file named `events.csv` in the project directory.

## Configuration

You can customize the scraper's behavior by modifying the configuration in the `config.py` file. This file allows you to adjust various settings such as the maximum number of events to scrape, the output file name, and the delay between requests to Facebook's servers to avoid rate limiting.

```python
# Configuration settings
MAX_EVENTS_TO_SCRAPE = 1000  # Maximum number of events to scrape
OUTPUT_CSV_FILE = "events.csv"  # Output CSV file name
REQUEST_DELAY_SECONDS = 2  # Delay between HTTP requests (in seconds)
```
